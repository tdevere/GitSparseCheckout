# RootFile1.yml
# SENTINEL: ROOT_FILE1_PRESENT
#
# This root-level YAML is a sentinel for cone-mode behaviour testing.
# In sparseCheckoutDirectories (cone mode) git ALWAYS materializes root-level files
# even when only a sub-directory is requested.  That is expected behaviour.
# In sparseCheckoutPatterns with "CDN/**" root-level files should NOT appear.
